Consider first a simple lamp (actuator) or thermostat (sensor)

Devices have zero or one "Master"

On server, device has three states:
	"Unknown" -- Master device never seen
	"Offline" -- Master device currently not connected to DCU
    "Online"  -- Webservice connection currently active

Value has timestamp, or is "none":

{profile: <device-profile> value: <device-specific-format> or Null, timestamp: iso-date-time}

profile - 		Reference to standard profile

iso-date-time - optionally stamped by device and preserved by server,
				otherwise stamped by server on reception.
				Format ISO 8601, always in UTC,
				resolution one millisecond:
				YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

value -			For lamp: 0 for off, 1 for on.
				For thermostat: {temperature: dd.d, unit: "celcius"}

Server needs to send its idea of current time with every message

Messages:

REG - Register
	{
	role: master/slave,
	id: <device id>
	[value: <device-specific-format>, // mandatory for master,
			??ignored?? or used as ??"set"?? for slave]
	[delay: default 0, age of returned value in milliseconds,
			to allow for return of "stale" values]
	}
	When received from master, results in VAL being sent to all slaves

SET - Change the value. Sent by slaves only;
		if received from master: ??treated as VAL??
								 ??protocol error??

VAL - report the value (sent by master or server only; ignored from slaves)
	  Propgated to all registered slaves
	  Sent by master in response to "SET"
	  Sent by server in response to "REG"
	  includes "Status"

DER - De-register
	  From master, results in "VAL" message being sent to slaves with status changed to "Offline".
